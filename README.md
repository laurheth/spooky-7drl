## A Horrible Labyrinth of  Wood and Upholstery

You came to this place, on a day like any other, to find some new furniture.

But the walls have closed in, all signs of human life are gone, and cursed wooden creatures now walk these halls.

You don't know what happened. But you do know you cannot stay here. Can you escape alive? Or will your bones be ground into cushion filler?

Furniture: Screws and Blood is a thrilling realtime survival horror roguelike adventure where you will do battle with possessed chairs, eldritch lamps, the undying Sofa of Eternity, and more.

### Features

- Descend through 8 procedurally generated furniture store display floors.
- Face 8 terrifying classes of foes who want to devour your soul.
- Find keys to unlock doors.
- Get annoyed and blow the doors up with bombs instead.
- Blow yourself up with the bombs by accident.
- Scary documents with secrets nobody should know.

### How to Play

- Move around with the arrow keys, wasd keys, mouse clicks, or touchscreen.
- Walk into most things to interact with them.
- Use the buttons to open and manage your inventory, to read documents, and to descend stairs to the next floor.
- Keyboard players can also use "i" to open inventory, "r" to read, and "g" to get items, and ">" to descend stairs.
- Tip: not all battles need to be fought. And if they must be fought, sometimes hit and run tactics will serve you best. Be brave, but only those with self preservation will make it out alive.
